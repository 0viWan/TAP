# T.A.P. -- the Thermo-Aggregation Project

The main and long-term goal of this project is to use sensor data from Arduinos modules to alert public health officials about communities that may be at risk for flu and infectious disease outbreaks.  The other goal of this project is to provide documentation to other Arduino enthusiasts on how to connect data

Using infrared non-contact thermometers in public places, we passively collect human temperatures and feed that data realtime to our servers. Our systems immediately identify communities with abnormal temperature readings to notify authorities about potential public health concerns.

In order to contribute to this open source project, people can upload data through their own Arduinos (an instruction guide will be provided for this), or if they have no access to an Arduino, people can also upload data with CSV files.
