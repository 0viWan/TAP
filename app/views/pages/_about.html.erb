<h4>Thermo Aggregation Project</h4>

<h5>We built this application to make public health officials aware of potential flu or infectious disease outbreaks early on â€” before small contagions evolve to become more serious public health concerns.  After receiving data from points all over the country, this site identifies cities that deviate from the expected distribution of normal human temperatures.  When a given city has an above-average amount of people with fevers, the site highlights that city so that public health officials might be able to respond accordingly.</h5>

<h5>Data is collected from infrared thermometer sensors built on Arduino Uno boards.  One of the benefits of using an infrared thermometer is that it can collect temperature data quickly and without actually making contact with a person.  This means that an Arduino device with an infrared thermometer sensor could be affixed to a building entrance and collect and transmit temperature data for every person that walked by it, providing hundreds of data points a day.</h5>

<h5>This application will work best when we have devices all over the country collecting and publishing information.  Stay tuned for more information regarding how to build or acquire your own Arduino device and post data to our site!
